"""
Core package for ₹500 Scalping Engine

This __init__.py is kept minimal to avoid breaking existing imports.
Import scalping engine components explicitly when needed.
"""

# Don't auto-import scalping modules to avoid breaking existing code
# that imports from core (like core.config, core.api, etc.)

# Scalping engine modules can be imported explicitly:
# from core.guardrails import GlobalGuardrails
# from core.scanner import MultiStockScanner
# from core.signal_generator import SignalGenerator
